Question 2

Create TCP connection to server, and keep it as long as needed. Server or client can easily close it. Client goes through HTTP compatible handshake process, if it succeeds, then server and client can exchange data both directions at any time. It is very efficient if application requires frequent data exchange in both ways. WebSockets do have data framing that includes masking for each message sent from client to server so data is simply encrypted.
