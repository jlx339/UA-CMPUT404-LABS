Question 1
REST stands for Representational State Transfer. (It is sometimes spelled "ReST".) It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- and in virtually all cases, the HTTP protocol is used.REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications. The idea is that, rather than using complex mechanisms such as CORBA, RPC or SOAP to connect between machines, simple HTTP is used to make calls between machines.

Question 2
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete.

Question 3
1xx Informational: Request received, continuing process.
2xx Success: indicates the action requested by the client.
3xx Redirection: indicates the client must take additional action to complete the request
4xx Client Error: indicates the errors made error.
5xx Server Error: indicates the errors made by server.

Question 4
Yeoman can help developers quickly build beautiful web applications. They take care of everything. However, it is hard to manufacturing or checking data. 

Question 5
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. (Source from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing)

Question 6
Make source code smaller and more maintainable. Get more contributions from the community. Issues are much easier to deal with in smaller extenstions. (Source from http://madskristensen.net/post/bundling-minification-and-client-side-compilation)
